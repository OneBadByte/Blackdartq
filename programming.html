        <h1>My favorites</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>C++: </li>
            <p>C++ was the first language I ever tried to learn. I wanted to try C++ because of the learning curve that
                its so famous for. I knew if I was destined to program that this would be the way to see if I liked it, and I
                fell in love with programming ever since learning just the basics of C++.</p>

            <li>Python:  </li>
            <p>Python was the first language that I learned in college in a intro to programming class. For a final project
                My team(classmates) and I decided to try and recreate "The Oregon Trail" with our own easter eggs and funny deaths
                that could befall the player. Python is probably one of my favorite languages to program in.</p>

            <li>Java: </li>
            <p>Java is the second langugae I learned in college and I'm still trying to get everything down. its really strange
                programming in such a heavy class based language, but I enjoy it all the same.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Web dev</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5/CSS3: </li>
            <p>Back in highschool I took a few webdesign classes and learned most of the basics there, currently I am taking
                a webdesign class and creating this very website during the downtime I get. I enjoy HTML and CSS because its so simple
                compared to the languages that I usually like to program in. it really lets me create what I want and work with
                the Design of my site that's bound to change.</p>

            <li>Javascript: </li>
            <p>Javascript reminds me of Python because of how easy it is to use, and how powerful it is.
                I'm still learning the basics from <a href="http://codeacademy.com">
                Code Academy</a> which I really enjoy their example.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bash and linux: </li>
            <p>From the time I started my job at <a href="http://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a> I've been creating Bash scripts
                to make my life easier and to help me do my job faster. I created a Bash script called "The Xfile" based off of the T.V
                series were they try to gather information. it was made to check on DNS,Whois info, if the website is mobile friendly,
                to SSH into servers more easily, and to update itself when I make changes to the code.<br><br>

                I've been using Ubuntu since November 2014 after I decided to try Windows 8, which deleted all my games and the files my
                laptop needed to change colors! so after a fit of rage at 3A.M in the morning I switched completely to Linux operating
                systems and try my best to never use windows if it can be helped. This isn't because I hate windows i just like the linux
                community and the control the user has over their machine.</p>
        </ul>
