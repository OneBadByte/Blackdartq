        <p> &nbsp &nbsp I started out programming after I was using unity3D back when I was 17, though I had no experience I wanted to make a game
        but its not the esaiest thing without nowing how to program at all.<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp That got me googling about what langauages
            might be good for me to learn, which lead me to C++ which was the first langauge I ever learned. the reason for me
            choosing that language from the many easier languages out there was because of the harsh learning curve and because of how
            powerful it is. I knew if I liked C++ and could handle the learning curve that I would truely know if I liked programming.
            <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp After that I took a few different web design classes where I worked with Dream weaver and other adobe software.
            When I was in high school I took an advanced web design class, and a robotics class, which made it possible for me to make this site, and
            made me want to get into the hobby of building drones.<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp When I'm not programming i'm usually reading, or playing guitar, though once and awhile
            when its sunny outside i'll go skateboarding, and in the winter I like to go snowboarding.
